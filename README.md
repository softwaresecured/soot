# What is Soot?

Soot is a Java optimization framework. It provides four intermediate representations for analyzing and transforming Java bytecode:

* Baf: a streamlined representation of bytecode which is simple to manipulate.
* Jimple: a typed 3-address intermediate representation suitable for optimization.
* Shimple: an SSA variation of Jimple.
* Grimp: an aggregated version of Jimple suitable for decompilation and code inspection.

See http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/ for details.

# How do I get started with Soot?

We have some documentation on Soot in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki) and also a large range of [tutorials](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/tutorial/index.html) on Soot.

# Including Soot in your Project

A Soot snapshot release is currently built for each commit to the `develop` branch. You can include Soot as 
a dependency via Maven, Gradle, SBT, etc using the following coordinates:


```.xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>ca.mcgill.sable</groupId>
    <artifactId>soot</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>soot-snapshot</id>
    <name>soot snapshots</name>
    <url>https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/nexus/repository/soot-snapshot/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>	

```

**Please make sure that your Java version is up to date to avoid problems with our SSL certificate**

You can also obtain older builds of the `develop` branch. A complete listing of builds can be found in our [Nexus repository](https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/nexus/#browse/browse/components:soot-snapshot).

# How do I obtain Soot without Maven?

**Note that the nightly build server has moved**

All of our Soot builds for the `develop` branch are stored up to one month in our [Nexus repository](https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/nexus/#browse/browse/components:soot-snapshot) and can be obtained from there.
The latest snapshot build of Soot can also be obtained [directly](https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/public/origin/develop/soot/soot-develop/build/). The "sootclasses-trunk-jar-with-dependencies.jar" file is an all-in-one file that also contains all the required libraries. The "sootclasses-trunk.jar" file contains only Soot, allowing you to manually pick dependencies as you need them. If you do not want to bother with dependencies, we recommend using the former.

# Building Soot yourself

If you cannot work with the prebuild versions and need to build Soot on your own, please consider the [wiki](https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Building-Soot-from-the-Command-Line-(Recommended)) for further steps.

# About Soot's source code

Soot follows the git-flow convention. Releases and hotfixes are maintained in the master branch.
Development happens in the develop branch. To catch the bleeding edge of Soot, check out the latter.
In case of any questions, please consult the Soot
mailing list at: http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mailman/listinfo/soot-list/
